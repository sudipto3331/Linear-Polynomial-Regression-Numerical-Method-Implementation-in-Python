# Linear-Polynomial-Regression-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of Linear Polynomial Regression for fitting a polynomial to a set of data points using the Gauss-Seidel method for solving the system of linear equations. The code reads data from an Excel file (`Regression.xls`), performs polynomial regression.
